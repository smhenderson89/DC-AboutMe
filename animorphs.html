        <br>

        <p>Since the pandemic started, I've been looking for some light fun books to read while the world is on fire.
           I remembered really enjoying the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animorphs">Animorphs</a> series as a kid.
           The series is best summarized by TV tropes <a href = "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">here</a>.</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">
                <p>One night, five teenagers discover that parasitic aliens, called Yeerks, are secretly infiltrating Earth by taking over people's bodies.
                They encounter an alien who is on their side, an Andalite named Elfangor, who, before dying from injuries sustained when his spaceship crashed,
                gives them the power to morph into any animal they have touched. Joined by Elfangor's younger brother and unable to trust almost anyone else,
                they begin a violent and secretive guerrilla war against the invading Yeerks to save the Earth.</p>
            </blockquote>
           <p>The Animorphs books were a mainstay of my childhood growing up, with over 60 books in the series. Each book is written by a different
           point of view of 5 teenagers (including one who gets trapped in a red-tailed hawk morph) and an alien who helps fight the Yeerks.
           It is incredible returning to the books both to see them as monster-of-the-week books to push the plot forward, but also examined
           themes of wartime ethics, feminism, the importance of diversity, suicide and others. Many of the trans community self identify
           with the Animorphs books, especially Tobias, a human teenager who becomes trapped in a red-tailed hawk and struggles to deal
           with his new reality in a body that doesn't feel like his own. <a href="https://news.avclub.com/read-this-animorphs-served-as-an-unlikely-parable-for-1798264861">(AV Club)</a></p>
        <p>
            K.A. Applegate also wrote an amazing letter <a href = "http://www.hiracdelest.com/database/articles/kaa_response-full.htm">(SPOILERS!)</a> when the series ended
            (with a cliff hanger), showing her viewpoints on war, a message the continues to resonate as American continues to be in continous wars in the middle east and other locations. What at face value seems like a kids book is something that is a well to come back again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The books are sadly out of print (although they can be downloaded with the author's blessing <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/Animorphs/comments/3litxl/reformatted_ebook_editions_download_links/">HERE</a>).
            There are also auidobooks release of the Animorphs coming out, you can listen to a sample of the book below:
